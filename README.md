**Purpose:** Our project aims to develop an engaging maze game application that challenges players' problem-solving skills and provides entertainment.



**Target Audience:** This project is created for gamers of all ages who enjoy puzzles and challenges.

**Personal Focus:** My primary focus in this project was to design captivating game mechanics and ensure an immersive user experience.

## Personal Story

Growing up in a bustling city, I often found solace in playing video games, especially ones that transported me to fantastical worlds. However, my love for games didn't stem solely from escapism; it also fueled my curiosity for game design and development. As a child, I spent countless hours tinkering with level editors and dreaming up my own game concepts. Fast forward to adulthood, and my passion for game development remains unwavering. This project isn't just about creating another game; it's about channeling that childhood fascination into a tangible creation that can bring joy to others, just as games did for me during my formative years.

## Project Accomplishments

**Result:** The maze game application features an intuitive interface, challenging levels, and smooth gameplay.

**Technologies Used:** For the frontend, we utilized HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript without additional frameworks to ensure optimal performance and customization. On the backend, we employed Python with Flask for its simplicity and flexibility. The game mechanics were implemented using Phaser, a robust HTML5 game framework.

**Features Completed:**
1. Dynamic maze generation algorithm to ensure each level is unique.
2. Smooth player controls for seamless navigation through the maze.
3. Scoring system and leaderboard integration to foster competition among players.

## Most Difficult Technical Challenge

Early in the development phase, integrating real-time multiplayer functionality posed a significant technical challenge. The situation required implementing a feature to allow multiple players to navigate the maze simultaneously. The task involved synchronizing player movements across different clients in real-time. To address this, I researched various networking libraries and protocols, ultimately opting for WebSockets due to their low latency and bi-directional communication capabilities. The action involved meticulously designing the server-client architecture, implementing message serialization, and handling synchronization conflicts. Despite encountering initial setbacks, through perseverance and collaboration with teammates, we successfully implemented the multiplayer feature, resulting in a seamless and engaging gaming experience for our users.

## Lessons Learned

This project has been an invaluable learning experience, providing insights into various aspects of game development and teamwork. From a technical standpoint, I gained a deeper understanding of networking protocols and real-time synchronization techniques. Additionally, collaborating with teammates highlighted the importance of effective communication and leveraging each other's strengths to overcome challenges. Moving forward, I aim to continue honing my skills in game development while embracing the iterative nature of the process.
